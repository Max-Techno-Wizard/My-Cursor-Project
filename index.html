    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/0*oa0XcvM99Y5clDsj.png" alt="Caret Cursor" style="width:100px; height:100px;">
    <p>The Caret Cursor is the default cursor. It tells us when nothing special is happening on the page — no links to click, nothing to move, and nothing to highlight. It basically shows that you're just pointing at regular, non-interactive space.</p>

    <h3>Pointer Cursor</h3>

    <p>The pointer cursor is the hand-shaped cursor that appears when you move your mouse over something to show that an element is clickable such as: links, buttons, interactive items, and things that take you somewhere when clicked.</p>

    <h3>Text Cursor</h3>

    <p>The text cursor, also known as the I-beam cursor, appears when you hover over text that can be selected or edited. It indicates that you can click to place the text insertion point or highlight text for copying, cutting, or formatting.</p>

    <h3>Crosshair Cursor</h3>

    <p>The crosshair cursor is a precise cursor that looks like a plus sign or cross. It is often used in graphic design and drawing applications to help users select specific points or areas on the screen with accuracy.</p>

    <h3>Move Cursor</h3>

    <p>The move cursor, often represented by a four-headed arrow, indicates that an element can be moved. It appears when you hover over draggable items, allowing users to click and drag the element to a new location on the screen.</p>
